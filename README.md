Disclaimer: I'm not a designer! The design for this project can be seen at https://startbootstrap.com/. I took the design and built it from the ground up with HTML 5, CSS 3, Sass & some vanilla JS, gulp is used for the task runner with gulp-sass for compiling sass & browser-sync for real-time site updates.

instructions:

#1 Clone
#2 npm install

- gulp watch will check all scss, js & html files for updates, browser sync will update them on the fly
- gulp build will compile the scss in to main.css and move all required files to dist
